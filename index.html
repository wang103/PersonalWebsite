My name is Tianyi Wang, "Tianyi" means "act of God" in Chinese language. I came from Beijing, China and I have lived in Chicago suburb for eight years.
</p>
<p>
I'm currently getting my Master of Science degree in computer science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I also attended UIUC for my undergraduate study in computer science. My primary interest is in operating systems.
</p>
<p>
My hobbies, other than writing code, include tennis, chess, and anime. I also enjoy playing billiard, although I'm still not very good at it yet.
