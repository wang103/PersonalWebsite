<p>&lt;title&gt;Welcome to my personal website!&lt;/title&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/head&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;body&gt;</p>
<p>My name is Tianyi Wang (王 天意), &quot;Tianyi&quot; means act of God in Chinese language. I came from Beijing China and I have lived in Chicago surburb for eight years already. I'm currently getting my Master of Science degree in computer science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I also attended UIUC for my undergraduate study in computer science. My primary interest is in operating system. My hobbies, other than writing code, include tennis, chess, and manga. I also enjoy playing biliard, although I'm still not very good at it yet.</p>
